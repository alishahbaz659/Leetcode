# Solving 150 Leetcode Problems Using Java

## Introduction

Welcome to my project where I solve the **Top 150 Leetcode Interview Questions** using Java. This repository is part of my preparation for technical interviews, and it follows the official Leetcode [Top Interview 150 Study Plan](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-interview-150/). The goal is to practice and improve my problem-solving skills by solving a variety of data structures and algorithms questions.

## Project Structure

Each problem will be solved in Java and organized into directories by category. The code for each problem will be accompanied by a brief description of the solution and the problem link.

### Problem Categories:
- **Array**
- **String**
- **Linked List**
- **Binary Tree**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Graph**
- **Backtracking**
- **Sorting and Searching**
- **Stack and Queue**
- **Greedy**

## How to Run the Solutions

Each problem's solution can be compiled and run individually. The solutions are written in Java and require Java 8 or above to compile and run.

### Steps to run:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/leetcode-150-java.git
   cd leetcode-150-java
2. Navigate to the problem folder and compile the .java file using:
   ```bash
   javac ProblemName.java
4. Run the compiled Java program:
```bash
   java ProblemName
